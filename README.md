# NBA-Draft-and-Player-Trade-Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to help the teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA) to draft better players and to trade players as well. As the sport of basketball evolves, it is important to modify the evaluation of the performance of players on the court. It is not enough to merely rely on points, rebounds and assists to determine who the best and most efficient players in the league are. It is vital for teams to identify talents by evaluating the players with the help of advanced reporting and statistical data. If a team needs to draft a new player, they need to scout the player for a long time in order to know more about a player’s abilities when they step on the court. So, with the help of advanced statistics and reports, the teams might be able to draft the player who suits their playstyle more. Along with that if a team needs to trade one of their players or is looking to trade a new player into the team, variables such as 3-point per cent per game or Field goal per cent per game play a major role in player selection. In this case, the teams might filter out players based on specific playstyles which consist of certain attributes or compare the players with the existing players to get a better read on what type of player they need in their roster. This type of statistical analysis is referred to as ‘Moneyball’, where the teams perform an in-depth analysis of the player’s in-game stats rather than solely depending on the physical attributes of a player. This helps smaller teams with smaller payrolls to identify talents early on and also to sign undervalued players.
